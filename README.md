# Resume App

This small, personal project simply displays my resume. My primary goal was to have a quick, easy way to see how changing various parts of my resume affects the layout (on screen and when printing). For instance, marking a position in my work history as `isRecent: false` will keep it fro displaying. This sort of change is useful for me to compare my complete resume to a shorter, more current version, allowing me to decide whether I need to adjust the layout.

## Tech Notes

The app is built using Angular, because that's the framework I've been using most recently. There is a good chance I'll be building it again in React at some point.

The app uses Tailwind. Although I've used CSS for many years (plain CSS, LESS, SASS, Bootstrap, etc.), I hadn't tried Tailwind.

## To-Do List:

This is not a comprehensive list.
